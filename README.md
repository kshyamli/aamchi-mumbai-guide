🚕 Aamchi Guide: The Ultimate Mumbai AI Agent
Navigating the pulse of Mumbai with street-smart intelligence.

"Aamchi Guide" is a full-screen, mobile-first AI chatbot built for the AI for Bharat Week 5 Challenge. Unlike generic AI, 
this bot is grounded in the unique cultural, geographical, and linguistic fabric of Mumbai. From finding a "Cutting" chai 
near IIT Bombay to navigating emergency hospital visits in a "Kaali-Peeli," this agent handles it all with authentic Bambaiya Vibe.



🧠 Features & "Complex Logic"
The app doesn't just match keywords; it understands User Intent through a multi-layered orchestration layer:

Multi-Intent Parsing: Effortlessly handles compound queries like "I'm at IIT, I'm hungry, and I need a cheap stay."

Contextual Grounding: Powered by a custom Knowledge Base in /.kiro/product.md, ensuring 100% factual accuracy for local spots.

Physiological Awareness: Intelligent routing that suggests "Low Energy" activities when the user feels sleepy or tired.

Marathi Transliteration Engine: Real-time English-to-Marathi translation with phonetic guides for seamless local interaction.


🎨 The Experience
Kaali-Peeli UI: An attractive, high-contrast Black & Yellow interface inspired by the iconic Mumbai taxi.

Immersive Mobile Design: A 100vh full-screen chat interface optimized for on-the-go travelers.

Bambaiya Personality: Every response is delivered in local lingo—Bhidu, Bantai, and Dada—making the AI feel like a local friend.
